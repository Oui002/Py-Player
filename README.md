# Py-Player [WIP]


## I want to run this but how?? (Ur not meant to run it yet, still working on things)
#### Well basically you just do
#### `python3 -m pip install pygame==2.1.0`
#### `python3 -m pip install ffmpeg-python`
#### `python3 -m pip install pydub`

Due to testing there might be some errors popping up about not being able to open certain files .ogg files, that's because they don't exit in the github repo, so if you get this error head over to [app/src/modules/music_player/config.json](https://github.com/Oui002/Py-Player/blob/master/app/src/modules/music_player/config.json) and change the current_song.name key to a music file that does exist.

And ta-da! You're all set to run this, just head over to the files, double click on run.pyw, or debug.py.
