# Py-Player
Music player using only the Python library Pygame for both playing the music and the displaying the GUI.

# I want to run this piece of junk, but how??
#### Well basically you just do
### `python3 -m pip install pygame==2.1.0`

And ta-da! ur all set to run this. Just head over to the files, double click on run.pyw, or debug.py, whichever one you like however I can assure you debug.py only gives you an annoying console, because I don't do any debugging!
