# Py-Player [WIP]
~~Music player using only the Python library Pygame for both playing the music and the displaying the GUI.
Was this a good idea? No. Is it fun, hec yes.~~

FFmpeg for the win amirite!

# I want to run this piece of junk, but how??
#### Well basically you just do
#### `python3 -m pip install pygame==2.1.0`
#### `python3 -m pip install ffmpeg-python`

And ta-da! ur all set to run this. Just head over to the files, double click on run.pyw, or debug.py. Whichever one you like, however, I can assure you debug.py only gives you an annoying console, because I don't do any debugging!

# Have fun :))
