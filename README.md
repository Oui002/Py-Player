# Py-Player [WIP]


## I want to run this piece of junk, but how??
#### Well basically you just do
#### `python3 -m pip install pygame==2.1.0`
#### `python3 -m pip install ffmpeg-python`
#### `python3 -m pip install pydub`

And ta-da! ur all set to run this. Just head over to the files, double click on run.pyw, or debug.py.

# Have fun :))
